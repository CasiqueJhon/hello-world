# hello-world

This is Jhon, I'm a beginner java developer specialized in Android apps, I'm based in Madrid and I have 29 years old.
I just want, just like everyone else here, learn more about it and probably collaborate with some projects to earn more experience. 

If someone know about something, please let me know.
